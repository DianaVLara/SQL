;

#3. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

AND length(orderID) = 6
;

#4. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT
COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum) as Customers
, AVG(quantity*price) as AverageSpent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND Feb.Quantity>2;

#8. What was the total revenue for each poduct in January?
